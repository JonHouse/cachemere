Cachemere
======

A nice, smooth, cushiony layer of cache.
Cachemere is a self-updating server-side caching engine which greatly reduces the number of disk i/o operations and the CPU load on your server.
Cachemere caches preprocessed and/or compressed file contents and updates them when they change on the file system.
It also generates all necessary client-side caching headers so its caching capabilities extend to the client - These headers can be modified as required before being sent.

To install, run:

```bash
npm install cachemere
```
